You are a data analyst working for an e-commerce company, responsible for analysing customer orders to gain insights into their purchasing behaviour. Your task is to write a SQL query to retrieve the details of the penultimate order for each customer. However, if a customer has placed only one order, you need to retrieve the details of that order instead, display the output in ascending order of customer name.

 

Table: orders

| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE   |
|---------------|-------------|
| order_id      | int         |
| order_date    | date        |
| customer_name | varchar(10) |
| product_name  | varchar(10) |
| sales         | int         |
