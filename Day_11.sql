/*Table: Employees
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |

In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.
The result format is in the following example. */

SELECT
    employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < 30000
AND manager_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Employees);
